# TicTacToeGame
Instructions:
Welcome to TicTacToe!
The game will ask you for your name. Type and enter a name for player 1 and for player 2.
Player 1 will be assigned "X", and Player 2 will be assigned "O".
After 2 secs, the game will start and show the the game title and the game board.
Next, player 1 will be prompted to select a number on the board where they'd like to place their piece.
If valid, their piece will be placed on the board. 
Player 2 will then be prompted for their choice.
If a position is chosen that already has a piece placed there, the game will tell you that position is taken, and reset to ask for a new choice to be made.
If the board is filled up, but no one has won, the game is a Draw/Tied and the game is over.
If a player wins, the game is also over! 
For either a win or a draw, you will be prompted to Play Again, or to Leave the Game.
The game will keep track of players' wins across multiple rounds played in a row. Keep playing to see who can get the highest score!
